# CubeSat Scrum
This repository contains CubeSat Scrum objectives, lesson plan, and instructor notes

## Learning objectives
- Explain what agile management is and how it differs from waterfall
- Understand how agile management can be used in physics student projects
- Explore a 3-4 hour learning activity for you to introduce agile management
- Experience empowerment that students feel when using agile management

## Required materials
The [paper templates](STEM%20Paper%20CubeSat%20Templates%20Jan%202018.pdf) are available in this repository. For each team print a copy of these templates on card stock (65 lbs weight works well, heavier becomes difficult to fold, user story cards on p45 through end can be 2-up). You will also need to get some easily obtained [crafts materials](Materials.md).

Additional teaching materials for the CubeSat Scrum workshop, including K-12 lesson plans developed by students at Old Dominion University, are available at [https://cubesatscrum.com/](https://cubesatscrum.com/) or directly on [DropBox](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/89eganxbdqvd47i/AAAYeD80DNVO_c1XdfdsbYWxa?dl=0).

## Suggested schedule
This activity will take up to 4 hours to complete. A [suggested schedule](Schedule.md) is available. You may also want to consider the different [roles](Roles.md) that all participants in the activity will be asked to play.

Although it is possible (if not recommended) to speed up this activity, this is not recommended in a first attempt at implementing the activity. The highest priority components are the iterative nature (more than 1 sprint), the use of a kanban board (and time to facilitate this), and the retrospection during the activity.

## Feedback?
If you implement this activity at your institution, please let us know about your experiences. If you have any questions, feel free to contact us. If you wish support or coaching, we may be able to work this out as well.
