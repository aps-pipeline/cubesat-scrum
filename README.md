# CubeSat Scrum
This repository contains CubeSat Scrum objectives, lesson plan, and instructor notes

## Learning objectives
- Explain what agile management is and how it differs from waterfall
- Understand how agile management can be used in physics student projects
- Explore a 3-4 hour learning activity for you to introduce agile management
- Experience empowerment that students feel when using agile management

## Materials
The [paper templates](templates.pdf) are available in this repository. For each team print a copy of these templates on card stock (80 lb works well, heavier becomes difficult to fold).

Facilitator materials:
- Classroom count-down clock (e.g. on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000J5OFW0/))
- Large flip chart sheets to attach to the wall
- Several rolls of 2" masking tape for name tags, attaching flip charts to the wall, 

The following equipment (per team) can be reused from workshop to workshop:
- 3 pairs of safety scissors (more may be made available for large teams)
- 3 rolls of tape (more may be made available for large teams)
- 1 x-acto knife to cut out internal parts (for older groups only)
- 4 wooden kabob sticks for puncturing paper to cut out internal parts and/or structural support of the frame
- 1 styrofoam square base 12" x 12" (e.g. at [Michael's](https://www.michaels.com/styrofoam-block--white--12-in-x-12-in/D063610S.html), can be left in plastic packaging as it mainly serves as a base in which to anchor the pipe cleaner)
- A kanban board, accomplished in any number of ways
> - a white boards with three columns "todo, doing, done" (careful when using sharpies with this option, may be better to have students write with white board marker on the post-its)
> - a flip chart page taped to the wall
> - a grid made with masking tape directly on the wall
- Multiple stacks of post-its
- Several black and/or colored sharpies (or white board markers)

The following list of supplies (per team):
- 4 pipe cleaners 12" and 4 thin coffee stirrer straws (these form the cubesat rails: plug the pipe cleaner into the styrofoam base board on a 4" x 4" square and slide the straw over the pipe cleaners, now the individual layers can be layered by threading the rails through the corner mounting holes of each layer)
- 3 styrofoam dinner plates or thick cardboard (components with a number indicated in a circle have to be filled with that many layers of styrofoam or cardboard to give them the necessary volume)

Additional teaching materials for the CubeSat Scrum workshop, including K-12 lesson plans developed by students at Old Dominion University, are available at [https://cubesatscrum.com/](https://cubesatscrum.com/) or directly on [DropBox](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/89eganxbdqvd47i/AAAYeD80DNVO_c1XdfdsbYWxa?dl=0).
