# CubeSat Scrum (by APS PIPELINE)
This repository contains CubeSat Scrum objectives, lesson plan, and instructor notes. These materials were developed with support of the [APS PIPELINE project](https://www.aps.org/programs/education/innovation/pipeline/)

## Learning objectives
- Explain what agile management is and how it differs from waterfall
- Understand how agile management can be used in student projects
- Explore a 3-4 hour activity for you to introduce agile management
- Experience empowerment that students feel when using agile management

## Required materials
The [paper templates](STEM%20Paper%20CubeSat%20Templates%20Jan%202018.pdf) are available in this repository. For each team print a copy of these templates on card stock (65 lbs weight works well, heavier becomes difficult to fold, user story cards on p45 through end can be 2-up). You will also need to get some easily obtained [crafts materials](Materials.md).

Additional teaching materials for the CubeSat Scrum workshop, including K-12 lesson plans developed by students at Old Dominion University, are available at [https://cubesatscrum.com/](https://cubesatscrum.com/) or directly on [DropBox](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/89eganxbdqvd47i/AAAYeD80DNVO_c1XdfdsbYWxa?dl=0).

Although it is possible (if not recommended) to speed up this activity, this is not recommended in a first attempt at implementing the activity. The highest priority components are the iterative nature (more than 1 sprint), the use of a kanban board (and time to facilitate this), and the retrospection during the activity. The competitive nature makes the activity more valuable with 2 smaller teams than 1 larger team, if
