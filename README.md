# CubeSat Scrum
This repository contains CubeSat Scrum objectives, lesson plan, and instructor notes

## Learning objectives
- Explain what agile management is and how it differs from waterfall
- Understand how agile management can be used in physics student projects
- Explore a 3-4 hour learning activity for you to introduce agile management
- Experience empowerment that students feel when using agile management

## Materials
The [paper templates](STEM%20Paper%20CubeSat%20Templates%20Jan%202018.pdf) are available in this repository. For each team print a copy of these templates on card stock (80 lb weight works well, heavier becomes difficult to fold, user story cards on p45 through end can be 2-up). You will also need to get some easily obtained [crafts materials](Materials.md).

Additional teaching materials for the CubeSat Scrum workshop, including K-12 lesson plans developed by students at Old Dominion University, are available at [https://cubesatscrum.com/](https://cubesatscrum.com/) or directly on [DropBox](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/89eganxbdqvd47i/AAAYeD80DNVO_c1XdfdsbYWxa?dl=0).

## Suggested schedule
This activity will take up to 4 hours to complete. A [suggested schedule](Schedule.md) is available. Although it is possible to speed up the activity, this is not recommended (certainly not in a first attempt).

## Feedback?
If you implement this activity at your institution, please let us know about your experiences.
