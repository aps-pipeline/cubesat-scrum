- Day 1 stand-up: 2 minutes (no work allowed, only discussion of who did and will do what)
- Day 1 work: 8 minutes
- Day 2 stand-up: 2 minutes (no work allowed, only discussion of who did and will do what)
- Day 2 work: 8 minutes
- Day 3 stand-up: 2 minutes (no work allowed, only discussion of who did and will do what)
- Day 3 work: 8 minutes
- Demonstration to product owner: 5 minutes (goals for next sprint are communicated)
- Retrospective: 5 minutes (4 minutes in team, 1 minute for finding themes across teams)

## Roles
- Mission director (i.e. instructor):
  - leads the activity,
  - keeps everyone on a strict time schedule,
  - ensures that tasks are written on post-its and moved through the kanban columns,
  - ensures not work is done during the non-work times.
- Scrum master per team (i.e. a regular team member who agrees to take on this role):
  - leads the sprint planning, stand-ups, demonstration, and retrospective,
  - does not act as a boss, but instead enables team productivity.
- Product owner per team (i.e. not a regular team member):
  - participates in sprint planning and demonstration,
  - expresses priorities and goals.
- Team members (everyone else), from 5 to 10 members per team:
  - write cards of tasks as they become apparent,
  - move their cards through the kanban columns,
  - stay focused on the tasks of the current sprint.
