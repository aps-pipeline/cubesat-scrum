# Materials

## Facilitator materials
- A large classroom count-down clock (e.g. on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000J5OFW0/)).
- Large 2' x 3' flip chart sheets to attach to the wall as kanban boards (see below) and to write out your activity [schedule](Schedule.md) (you may want to add a checkmark when you complete a step, so the teams don't lose track of where they are).
- Several rolls of 2" masking tape for name tags, attaching flip charts to the wall, creating kanban columns, etc...
- A large sharpie for name tags and to write out your activity [schedule](Schedule.md).

## Equipment that can be reused (per team)
- Full set of [cubesat templates](STEM%20Paper%20CubeSat%20Templates%20Jan%202018.pdf) on card stock (65 lbs weight works well, 80 lbs weight may be a bit too thick).
- 1 styrofoam square base 12" x 12" (e.g. at [Michael's](https://www.michaels.com/styrofoam-block--white--12-in-x-12-in/D063610S.html), keep in plastic packaging to prevent styrofoam waste since this merely serves as a base in which to anchor the pipe cleaners).
- 1 paper lunch bag to contain following materials and serve as paper trash bag for recyclables.
- 3 pairs of safety scissors (more may be made available for large teams).
- 3 tape dispenser rolls (more may be made available for large teams).
- 1 x-acto knife to cut out internal parts (for older groups only).
- 4 kabob sticks for puncturing paper in order to cut out internal parts and/or additional structural support of the frame.
- A kanban board, accomplished in a number of ways:
> - a white boards with three columns "todo, doing, done" (but be careful when using sharpies; note that writing tasks directly on the white board should be discouraged)
> - a flip chart page taped to the wall
> - a grid made with masking tape directly on the wall
- Multiple stacks of post-its (3" x 6" notecard size is better than the 3" x 3" squares).
- Several black and/or colored sharpies and/or white board markers.

## Supplies (per team)
- 4 pipe cleaners 12" and 4 coffee stirrer straws. These form the cubesat rails: plug the pipe cleaner into the styrofoam base board in a 4" x 4" square and slide a straw over each of the pipe cleaners. Now the individual cubesat layers can be threaded over the rails with the corner mounting holes.
- Thick 1/16" cardboard, about 12" x 12". Components with a number indicated in a circle have to be filled with that many layers of cardboard to give them the necessary volume and stability.
